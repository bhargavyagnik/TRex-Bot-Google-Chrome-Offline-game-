# TRex-Bot-Google-Chrome-Offline-game-
This is a simple Quarantine Fun activity motivated by an arduino bot to play Trex game. I used OpenCV to build this bot. I needs a split screen window on 1920*1080 screen.

This is a simple python bot that is automated using PyautoGui and Opencv to recognize the obstacles in the Trex game and then make the Trex jump accordingly.
Will add video and more improvements soon.

This is a single day work .
Also will add the motivation video where it  was done using arduino and hardware
