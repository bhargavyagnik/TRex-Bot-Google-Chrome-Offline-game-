# TRex-Bot-Google-Chrome-Offline-game-
This is a simple Quarantine Fun activity motivated by an arduino bot to play Trex game. I used OpenCV to build this bot. I needs a split screen window on 1920*1080 screen.

This is a simple python bot that is automated using PyautoGui and Opencv to recognize the obstacles in the Trex game and then make the Trex jump accordingly.
